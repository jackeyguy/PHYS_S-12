<body>
  <p> Pretty basic documentation,  <a href="https://nathanmelenbrink.github.io/intro-dig-fab/12_wildcard/casting.html">instruction for molding</a>. So I wanted to just mold something simple like my lock so I did but it seemes that I went a little too far with the box so when it came out(which came out pretty nicely(not very sticky), it went completely through so it won't really work as a mold.</p>


<img src="./rip.jpg" alt = "database" class = "img-responsive" width = "40%"/> 
<img src="./fail.jpg" alt = "pic" class = "img-responsive" width = "40%"/> 

<p>But it seemed to have picked up some of the pattern from the actual box so that was pretty cool so I guess next time I should choose a better design and make sure it doesn't actually touch the bottom. </p>
