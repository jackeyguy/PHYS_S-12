  <p>Today, we we reviewed some stuff about microboards and also some motors and how to use them in the arudino IDE. I made the basic connection and used the basic code like in Nathan's website. Next I tried to make it so that the potentiometer would affect how fast or slow the motor would move, once again I followed the basic set up that nathan gave. It worked but that's when I ended up running into some trouble.</p>

  <p> My board all of a sudden would not stop moving which was not the same thing as the code which made it so that the speed of the motor would depend on the potentiometer. I tried multiple ways to try to fix it like restarting the board and trying to resave the code on the microcontroller. Eventually, the problem seemed to have gotten worse in that it would run for 5 seconds before the board would just completely set down, it also felt pretty hot. I'm not too sure how I was suppose to progress.</p>

<p> So I couldn't really do the project without the motor actually working but what I wanted to do was to have the potentiometer change the speed on te motor which I could then attach a stick or something to the motor to hit a cup or something. By having the different speeds and frequencies of hitting it, it would make a different pitch and boom that's the intrument. I will admit, this wasn't 100% my idea rather it was suggested to me by Victoria. But it seems that I can't really execute it because my board seems a bit broken at the moment.</p>

<p><b>Yo, back after finishing the final but I guess I'll just consider the whole lock mechanism as this weeks assignment.</b> So basically I just used a tutorial that I found on YouTube that shows how to use a servos motor as a lock with some 3D printed parts. This worked out pretty decently for my final project but not as well as it should've considering I had a lot of trouble having it stick together. All of that documentation can be found on the <a href="https://jackeyguy.github.io/PHYS_S-12/Final_Project/index.html">Final Project</a> page. </p>
