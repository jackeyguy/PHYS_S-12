  <p>Today, we were introduced to some basic electronics and ciruits. I already had some experience in voltage and current and resistance(Ohm's Law) but I had never actually made my own ciruit or seen a physical one because school was virutal.</p>

  <p> Learning to use the breadboard was pretty interesting. It was unfortunately pretty difficult to learn how to use the breadboard and make the circuit on the zoom call so I had to learn it myself through a few videos. What was pretty interesting to me was that there are some parts of the breadboard that works and some that doesn't. I'm not too sure how to explain everything so I'm just going to link the video that I used down below.

<p> After watching that enlighening video, I was finally able to get the LED on in my simple circuit. Next step was to learn how to use the multimeter. I yet again watched another vidfeo that helped me figure how to use the tool and also found little tiny grabber things that would make it easier for me to connect things to the wires and get an accurate reading.</p>

<p> I realized that my reading for my voltage was only 1.66 and not the actual 3.3 volts that I thought I set it at. This was a pretty easy fix because I realized that i had the wire on the wrong hole for the input. my bad. At the end, I can now measure the resistance and voltage at a point and then by using Ohm's law (V= IR), I can then calculate for the current.</p>

<p>Do I tried to put some other components in my ciruit. I'm going pretty simple with it and just adding a button. A problem that I first ran into was that the light would still light up when I didn't even press the button, which means the circuit probably shorted somehwere. </p>

</video>
<p>To counter this, I tried a different path and changed the wiring up a little to maek sure that the current didn't have an alternate pathway to the button. After changing it, it started to work.</p>

<p> Next, I tried to make the same circuit in Tinkercad and I ran into some trouble because the simulator only have the 4 prong button rather than the 2 prong one. I had to try to work around this and it seemed to eventually work out.</p>
