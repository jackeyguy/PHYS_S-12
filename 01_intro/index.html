  <p>Today's class was quite a nice introduction. I was happy that I was able to meet the professors. What was very surprising to me is that this class is very open ended. I can't wait for what this class will bring. </p>

  <p>Firstly, we brainstormed some ideas. I really want to somehow incorporate the Rubik's cube into my project. I am also really glad that I was able to have a deccent conversation with my group members. Hoping these next few weeks will be full of learning and fun.</p>

  <p>Another thing we were given as assignment was to create a website. This is completely new for me so this really intimidated me. I am not great with coding so using html seemed very scary. I did end up getting the help of my friend to help create this website. One major problem that I seemed to have was that it was kind of difficult for me to find out how to google things, aka I didn't know how to center an image. That was quickly resolved with an inspired suggestion of using google. </p>

  <p>I also played around with the background and figured out how to get a gradiant like look. All is still in testing but I may end up using a template because my website does look pretty boring at the moment.</p>
