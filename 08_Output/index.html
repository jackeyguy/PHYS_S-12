<p>So for this assignment, we had to use an output device that we never used before. I thought of using the buzzer and making a pretty simple melody and just overall learn how the thing works.</p>
<p> Keeping time in mind, I just tried to search for song online and found Take on Me by aha, which I chose immediately because the song is just amazing. There was just a loop in the iconic beginning melody. I tried to upload it and ran into a problem. The file said I needed to have a pitch file or something. I looked further into this and realized that I just needed to make a new file and copy and paste the basic notes that were needed. After that, it was smooth sailing</p>

<p>For my final project, I think I'm going to do something with a premade smart cube because I don't think I really have the time or skill to make my own. But I found a video of someone that was able to hack it and I think it will be really useful in my final project because it opens up a ton of possibilities.</p>
