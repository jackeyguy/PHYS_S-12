  <p>This week we learned about some programming stuff such as loops and conditional statements like if and else stuff. We had to make a program that used a button and a for loop to control some kind of output. The programming was pretty similar to java that I knew, so it wasn't too bad.</p>
  <p> I just made something pretty simple, I followed along to a video I found on YouTube that was basically three lights that would come on one at a time and then turn off one at a time. AFter following their inital set up and code. I then added a button and then changed the code so that there would be a for loop. I didn't make anything overcomplicated, just made a loop that would change the speed of the LED coming on and off at a faster and faster time</p>

  <p> I also modified the code a bit so that the button wouldn't have to be a hold type and instead it would be more like a start button. I also didn't have anotherv 100 ohm resistor so I used two 100 ohm resistors and a 470 ohm resistor</p>
